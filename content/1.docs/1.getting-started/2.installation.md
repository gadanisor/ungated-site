## Verify downloads (optional)

::callout
For extra safety, you can verify the download using **SHA-256 checksums**.
::

:::collapsible
| File | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `Ungated-macOS.dmg` | `SHA256_HEX_FOR_MAC_DMG` |
| `Ungated-Windows.exe` | `SHA256_HEX_FOR_WINDOWS_EXE` |
| `Ungated.AppImage` | `SHA256_HEX_FOR_LINUX_APPIMAGE` |
:::

:::tabs{.w-full}

::::tabs-item{label="macOS" icon="i-lucide-apple"}
```bash
shasum -a 256 Ungated-macOS.dmg
```
Compare the output with the checksum above.
::::

::::tabs-item{label="Windows" icon="i-lucide-monitor"}
```powershell
Get-FileHash .\Ungated-Windows.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```
Compare the output with the checksum above.
::::

::::tabs-item{label="Linux" icon="i-lucide-terminal"}
```bash
sha256sum Ungated.AppImage
```

## First Launch

When Ungated opens for the first time, you can:

- **Create a new project**, or
- **Open an existing folder** (Markdown / plain text)

::tip
Don’t worry about setting up everything upfront. Start writing first — structure can grow alongside your project.
::

## Updates

Ungated updates won’t touch your projects.

- Download the latest release from the website, or
- Use in-app updates (when available)

---

## Troubleshooting

:::accordion

::::accordion-item{label="macOS says “Ungated is damaged”" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
This can happen when Gatekeeper quarantines the app. Remove quarantine attributes:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Ungated.app
```
::::

::::accordion-item{label="Linux AppImage doesn’t launch" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Make sure the file is executable, then run it:

```bash
chmod +x Ungated.AppImage
./Ungated.AppImage
```
::::

::::accordion-item{label="Where are my projects stored?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Ungated projects live **where you create them** on your disk. Ungated works offline and doesn’t move your files unless you choose to.
