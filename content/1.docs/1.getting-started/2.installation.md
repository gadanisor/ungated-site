## Troubleshooting

:::accordion

::::accordion-item{label="macOS says “Ungated is damaged”" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
This can happen when Gatekeeper quarantines the app. Remove quarantine attributes:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Ungated.app
```
::::

::::accordion-item{label="Linux AppImage doesn’t launch" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Make sure the file is executable, then run it:

```bash
chmod +x Ungated.AppImage
./Ungated.AppImage
```
::::

::::accordion-item{label="Where are my projects stored?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Ungated projects live **where you create them** on your disk. Ungated works offline and doesn’t move your files unless you choose to.
