## Create your first project

:::steps{level="3"}

### Create a project
When Ungated opens, click **New Project**.

Choose:
- a project name
- a location on your disk

Ungated creates a folder containing your writing files in plain text / Markdown.

### Open the workspace
Once created, the workspace appears with:
- the editor in the center
- the sidebar for navigation
- your project structure on the left

### You’re ready to write
Create your first document and start typing — no setup required.

:::

::tip
Your project is just a folder on your computer. You can open it anytime, back it up manually, or sync it using your preferred tools.

## Write your first scene

:::steps{level="3"}

### Create a new document
Use the sidebar or press :kbd{value="meta"} :kbd{value="N"} to create a file.

### Start drafting
Write normally — Ungated saves automatically.

### Use Markdown naturally
You can use headings, emphasis, lists, and notes as you write.

```md
# Chapter One

The rain started before dawn.
```

## Create your first component

Ungated treats story elements as **components**.

Instead of keeping characters or locations in separate notes, they become structured parts of your world.

:::steps{level="3"}

### Add a character
Create a new **Character** component from the sidebar.

### Fill basic information
Add a name, description, or notes.

### Link it to your writing
Mention the character inside a scene and connect it.

:::

::callout
This is the core idea behind Ungated:  
your story is not just text — it’s a connected system.
::

---

## Link things together

As you write, you can connect:

- characters ↔ scenes
- locations ↔ events
- plot points ↔ timelines

These relationships help Ungated keep your world coherent as it grows.

::tip
You don’t need to structure everything upfront. Most writers discover structure naturally while drafting.

## Reading Mode

Switch to **Reading Mode** to view your draft like a finished manuscript.

- adjustable typography
- distraction-free layout
- ideal for reviewing pacing and flow

Use Reading Mode when revising or sharing previews with others.
