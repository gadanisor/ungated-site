Welcome to **Ungated** — a creative IDE built for writers and world-builders.

Ungated combines drafting, worldbuilding, and story structure into a single calm workspace, so you can write without constantly switching tools or losing context. Instead of managing scattered documents and notes, your entire story lives in one connected project.

This section will guide you through the fundamentals needed to start writing comfortably in Ungated.

## What makes Ungated different?

Ungated is designed around flow and structure working together:

- **Write freely** in a fast, distraction-free editor
- **Connect everything** — characters, places, scenes, and plot threads
- **Keep ownership** of your work with local, Markdown-based projects
- **Stay organized automatically** as your story grows

You don’t need to configure everything upfront. Most concepts become clear as you begin writing.

## What you’ll learn in Getting Started

In this section, you’ll learn how to:

- create and understand a project
- navigate the workspace
- write your first drafts
- understand components and relationships
- organize story elements without breaking your flow

Each page builds on the previous one, so it’s best to follow them in order the first time.

## A quick mindset shift

Ungated is closer to an **IDE for storytelling** than a traditional writing app.

Instead of thinking in isolated documents, you’ll work with connected pieces of your story — scenes, characters, locations, and narrative threads — all evolving together as you write.

Don’t worry about mastering everything immediately. Start writing first; structure will grow naturally alongside your work.
