We’re excited to release **Ungated v0.1.0**, the first public beta.

This version marks the beginning of Ungated as a creative IDE for writers — a local-first workspace where drafting, worldbuilding, and story structure live together.

The goal of this release is simple: get Ungated into real writing workflows and start learning from how people actually use it.

## Highlights

- Fast, keyboard-centric drafting editor
- Local-first projects stored directly on your machine
- Component system for characters, scenes, locations, and story elements
- Relationship awareness between story elements
- Rich metadata and synopsis support
- Reading Mode for distraction-free review
- Markdown-based projects (plain text, future-proof)
- Cross-platform desktop builds (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Beta status

The app is currently in **beta**. You may encounter rough edges, missing features, or unexpected behavior.

During this phase, the focus is on:

- validating core writing workflows
- improving stability and performance
- refining the component and relationship model
- learning how writers naturally use the tool

Feedback is extremely valuable at this stage and directly shapes future development.

## Local-first by design

Your writing stays yours:

- projects live on disk
- works fully offline
- no forced accounts or cloud dependency
- plain text / Markdown at the core

## What’s next

Upcoming iterations will focus on:

- workflow polish and usability improvements
- deeper relationship visualization
- improved navigation and discovery
- collaboration foundations
- performance optimizations for large projects

Thank you for being early to Ungated. This is only the beginning.
