## Ungated is now in Public Beta

After months of building, testing, and refining the core ideas behind Ungated, we’re opening the doors to the **public beta**.

Ungated is a creative IDE for writers — a calm, local-first workspace where drafting, worldbuilding, and story structure exist together. This beta marks the first time the tool is available for real writing workflows outside our internal testing.

---

## What beta access means

Anyone joining the beta program gets:

- ✅ **Full access to all features**
- ✅ Paid functionality unlocked during beta
- ✅ Early access to experimental tools
- ✅ Direct influence on the product’s direction

There are no feature tiers during beta. The goal right now is learning how writers actually use Ungated in real projects.

::note
Beta access is temporary and exists to help us improve the product before the official stable release.

## Why we’re doing a beta

Ungated isn’t a traditional writing app. It introduces a different way of working — treating stories as connected systems rather than isolated documents.

Because of that, real feedback matters more than polished marketing.

We want to understand:

- how writers structure projects in practice
- where workflows feel natural (or confusing)
- which tools genuinely help flow
- what breaks when projects grow large

Your usage directly shapes what Ungated becomes.

## What to expect

This is an early version. You may encounter:

- unfinished edges
- missing quality-of-life features
- occasional bugs or rough interactions

That’s expected — and extremely helpful.

::warning
Beta versions should not be considered production-stable yet. Always keep backups of important work.
::

## Local-first, even in beta

Ungated stays true to its core principles:

- projects live on your disk
- works fully offline
- no forced accounts or cloud lock-in
- plain text / Markdown projects

Your writing remains yours.

## How to join

Create a beta tester account and download the latest build from the website.

Once inside, just start writing. No configuration required.

::tip
The best way to test Ungated is simple: use it for a real story, not a demo project.

## What happens next

During the beta phase, development will focus on:

- improving writing flow and performance
- refining the component and relationship system
- polishing navigation and usability
- preparing collaboration features
- stabilizing large projects

Expect frequent updates and rapid iteration.

Thank you for being early.

Ungated is being built **with writers, not just for writers** — and this beta is the first real step in that journey.
